# PUMATAC Tutorial
Tutorial for [PUMATAC (Pipeline for Universal Mapping of ATAC-seq)](https://github.com/aertslab/PUMATAC).  
Please follow all notebooks in order.

In notebook `5_qc_diagnosis.ipynb`, you can find a detailed and ready-to-run notebook that will reproduce the main quality plots in our manuscript, but for your data. This includes cell filtering based # fragments and TSS, violin plots for #fragments, TSS enrichment and FRIP, the stacked bar plot for the fraction of reads lost at each stage, and saturation plots.
